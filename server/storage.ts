# Fighter Class Overview

Fighters excel at combatâ€”defeating their enemies through superior weapons and armor. They are skilled in a variety of fighting styles, from two-handed weapons to sword and shield tactics. In Baldur's Gate 3, fighters are strong frontliners who can absorb damage and dish out consistent damage.

## Fighter Class Stats

- **Hit Dice**: d10
- **Primary Ability**: Strength or Dexterity
- **Saving Throws**: Strength, Constitution
- **Armor Proficiency**: All armor, shields
- **Weapon Proficiency**: Simple and martial weapons
- **Tool Proficiency**: None

## Key Fighter Features

### Fighting Style
At 1st level, fighters adopt a particular style of fighting. Choose from options like Archery, Defense, Dueling, Great Weapon Fighting, Protection, or Two-Weapon Fighting. Each provides unique benefits.

### Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. As a bonus action, you can regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once used, you must take a short or long rest before using it again.

### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once used, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.

## Recommended Ability Scores

- **Strength**: 15-16 (Primary for melee fighters)
- **Dexterity**: 14-16 (Useful for AC and ranged attacks)
- **Constitution**: 14-16 (More health and CON saves)
- **Intelligence**: 8-10 (Important for Eldritch Knight)
- **Wisdom**: 10-12 (Helps with Perception)
- **Charisma**: 8-10 (Not essential for fighters)

## Pro Tips

- **Position Wisely**: As a fighter, you'll want to position yourself between enemies and your more vulnerable allies.
- **Conserve Resources**: Save Action Surge for critical moments when you need burst damage.
- **Know Your Role**: Depending on your build, you might be the party's tank, damage dealer, or a mix of both.
- **Tactical Advantage**: Use height and terrain to gain combat advantages when possible.

2. **Trip Attack**: Knock enemies prone to give melee allies advantage on attacks.
3. **Riposte**: Counter-attack when an enemy misses you.
4. **Precision Attack**: Add to your attack roll when you need it most.

## Recommended Builds

# Eldritch Knight Guide

The Eldritch Knight is a fighter subclass that combines martial prowess with arcane magic. You gain access to wizard spells, primarily from the Abjuration and Evocation schools.

## Key Features

- **Spellcasting**: You can cast wizard spells, primarily from the Abjuration and Evocation schools.
- **Weapon Bond**: You can bond with up to two weapons, allowing you to summon them to your hand as a bonus action.
- **War Magic**: Starting at 7th level, you can cast a cantrip and make a weapon attack as a bonus action.

## Recommended Spells

### Cantrips
- **Booming Blade**: Great for controlling enemy movement.
- **Green-Flame Blade**: Good for dealing with groups of enemies.
- **Blade Ward**: Reduce incoming damage when needed.

### 1st Level
- **Shield**: Boost your AC when you need it most.
- **Absorb Elements**: Reduce elemental damage and add it to your next attack.
- **Magic Missile**: Guaranteed damage that doesn't require an attack roll.

## Ability Score Priorities

1. **Strength/Dexterity**: Still your primary stat for attacks and damage.
2. **Intelligence**: Powers your spells, but can be secondary.
3. **Constitution**: Important for concentration checks and hit points.

## Tips and Tricks

- Use your spells to supplement your combat abilities, not replace them.
- Focus on spells that don't rely heavily on your Intelligence score.
- Use War Magic to cast a cantrip and then make a weapon attack.
